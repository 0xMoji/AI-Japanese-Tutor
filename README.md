# AI-Japanese-Tutor
Practice listening and speaking skills with this AI Japanese tutor.

**Pain points:**
1. I've been learning Japanese on Duolingo for over 250 consecutive days. It's an awesome app! However, it has its downsides. After almost a year of practice, I still do not feel like I can understand real Japanese (meaning when a Japanese person speaks at their normal speed on random topics). The types of questions we get to answer on Duolingo are mostly in the same patterns.
2. When encountering Kanji (汉字), I don't know how to pronounce it, nor do I know its meanings. Kanji is a crucial part of the Japanese language, and Japanese people use Kanji, Furigana, or Katakana interchangeably. I want an app that can show me how to pronounce it by actually speaking it in Japanese, explaining its meanings, and showing its Furigana or Romanized Pinyin.
3. I want to engage in interesting conversations with Japanese people!

**Solutions:**
1. Using OpenAI's ChatGPT to tackle the problem of translation and to display Kanji, Furigana, Katakana, and Romanized Pinyin using prompt engineering.
2. Using OpenAI's voice model Whisper to mimic Japanese speakers.
3. Prompt engineering with ChatGPT to come up with interesting conversation topics.

**Functionalities:**
1. **Speaking Comfortably:** Learners can choose to start a conversation in Japanese or in their mother tongue. If they start a conversation in Japanese, the dialogue begins. If they start in their mother tongue, this AI tutor helps them translate the sentence into Japanese, showing Furigana and Romanized Pinyin, and then teaches them how to speak by actually speaking it.
2. **Practice, Practice, Practice:** Learners can choose to replay an audio clip as many times as needed until they fully grasp the pronunciation.
3. **Interesting Conversations:** Talk about anything you want, or the AI tutor will generate an interesting topic for you!
