# AI-Japanese-GF-Tutor
Practice listening and speaking skills with this AI Japanese girlfriend-like tutor. Win her acceptance through improved Japanese!❤️ 

**🤔Why This App?**
1. I've been learning Japanese on Duolingo for over 250 consecutive days. It's an awesome app! However, it has its downsides. After almost a year of practice, I still do not feel like I can understand real Japanese (meaning when a Japanese person speaks at their normal speed on random topics). The types of questions we get to answer on Duolingo are mostly in the same patterns.
2. When encountering Kanji (汉字), I don't know how to pronounce it, nor do I know its meanings. Kanji is a crucial part of the Japanese language, and Japanese people use Kanji, Hiragana, or Katakana interchangeably. I want an app that can show me how to pronounce it by actually speaking it in Japanese, explaining its meanings, and showing its Furigana or Romanized Pinyin.
3. I want to engage in interesting conversations with Japanese people!
